Mall Customer Segmentation


In this project , I have used KMeans to segregate the customers in a mall , on the basis of their Annual Income and thier Spending Score , which is basically based on consumer behaviour and purchasinng data.


The Classification / segregation was done using elbow method of KMeans classification. In which using Elbow method we find the  value of K for which the clustering would work perfectly.

So using that, I trained a model by KMeans. And then hence plotted a Scatterrplo. 

The Dataset is take from Kaggle.
